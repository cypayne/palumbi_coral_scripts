## FLASH merges PE reads

## at prompt, type "bash batch-flash.sh *_1_paired.fastq" 
## you can only merge paired files

## OPTIONS
## -m 10	minimum require overlap length between two reads to provide confident overlap, default 10bp

## CONVENIENCE PARAMETERS FOR CALCULATING MAX OVERLAP. Get these values for your data by running fastxQC.sh and putting into Galaxy
## -r 	read length 
## -f 	fragment length. what's the average from your bioanalyzer plot?
## -s 	fragment standard deviation, ~15-20% fragment length

## Put in your outputs from FastQC and Bioanalyzer
r=125
f=250
s=50
