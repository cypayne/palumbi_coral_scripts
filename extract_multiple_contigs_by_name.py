''' Script to extract multiple full contigs, based on names specified
    in input contig_names file

    If you want all of your contigs in a single file, use the following:
    usage: ./extract_multiple_contigs_by_name.py seq_file.fasta contig_names.txt single 
    output: single file named 'contigs.fasta'

    If you want your contigs in their own, individual files, use the following:
    usage: ./extract_multiple_contigs_by_name.py seq_file.fasta contig_names.txt multiple
    output: multiple files, named after contig names
